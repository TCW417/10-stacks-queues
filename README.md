====


This lab exports two classes, Stack and Queue

### Stack class

The stack class is an O(1) for space and time class that implements a stack (Last In First Out data structure) using an underlying doubly-linked list. 

#### Methods

##### `Stack.push(item1 [, item2...])`

Push one or more items onto the stack. The last item pushed will be the first item popped (removed) from the stack.

##### `Stack.pop()`

Remove the last item pushed onto the stack.

#### `Stack.peek()`

Return the value at the top of the stack without removing it. Operates just like Stack.pop() without actually removing the item from the stack.

### Queue class

The queueu class is an O(1) for space and time class that implements a queue, a First-in-First-out (FIFO) data structure.

#### Methods

##### `Queue.enqueue(item1 [, item2...])`

Add one or more items to the queue.  Item1 will be at the head of the queue and the first item to be dequeued.

##### `Queue.dequeue()`

Remove the item at the head of the queue.

##### `Queue.peek()`

Examine the item at the head of the queue but do not remove it.
